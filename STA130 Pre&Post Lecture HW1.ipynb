    "\n",
    "Before removing the missing data, there are 891 rows, which 688 of them contained a missing data in \"deck\", therefore removing this column would prevent df.dropna() from removing an excessive amount of data. Continuing, 177 missing data is found in age and 2 in embark_town. I believe age is a necessary column when analyzing people's survival rate on the titanic, therefore the column is kept and rows with missing age is removed. Lastly, only 2 embark_town data are missing, which is small compared to the size of the dataset, therefore the rows with missing embark_town are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the missing data are removed, the size of the dataset is cut to 712 rows and 14 columns, with variables that may help the analysis of the demographics on the titanic, such as survived, age, and alone."

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Loading and Inspecting the Pokémon Dataset**\n",
    "   - You loaded the Pokémon dataset and asked for help with basic DataFrame operations in pandas.\n",
    "   - We used `df.head()` to inspect the first few rows and `df.columns` to list the column names.\n",
    "   - We also used `df.shape` to check the size of the dataset (800 rows and 12 columns).\n",
    "   - I explained the difference between observations (rows) and variables (columns), with Pokémon stats like HP, Attack, Defense, and Legendary status serving as variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Summary Statistics Using `df.describe()` and `df['column'].value_counts()`**\n",
    "   - I provided code to summarize numeric data using `df.describe()` and generate counts for categorical data using `df['Type 1'].value_counts()`.\n",
    "   - This allowed us to get an overview of Pokémon stats like HP, Attack, Defense, and the distribution of different Pokémon types.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Handling Missing Values in the Titanic Dataset**\n",
    "   - You asked about discrepancies between `df.shape` and `df.describe()`. I explained that `df.describe()` analyzes only numeric columns by default and reports the count of non-null (non-missing) values.\n",
    "   - We discussed missing values in the Titanic dataset, which caused the \"count\" in `df.describe()` to be lower than the total number of rows due to NaN values in columns like `Age` and `Embarked`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Explaining Key Summary Statistics from `df.describe()`**\n",
    "   - I defined the summary statistics from `df.describe()`:\n",
    "     - `count`, `mean`, `std`, `min`, `25%`, `50% (median)`, `75%`, and `max`.\n",
    "   - These statistics provide insights into the central tendency and spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Difference Between `del df['col']` and `df.dropna()`**\n",
    "   - I explained that `del df['col']` permanently removes a specific column, while `df.dropna()` removes rows (or columns) with missing values.\n",
    "   - The key difference is that `del df['col']` modifies the DataFrame in place by deleting a column, while `df.dropna()` removes rows or columns with missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Importance of Using `del df['col']` Before `df.dropna()`**\n",
    "   - I emphasized that using `del df['col']` before `df.dropna()` can prevent unnecessary row deletions by first removing columns with a large number of missing values that may not be relevant for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Removing Missing Data from the Titanic Dataset**\n",
    "   - You requested an approach to remove all missing data using a combination of `del df['col']` and `df.dropna()`.\n",
    "   - I suggested analyzing the missing data first and then deleting unnecessary columns with many missing values (e.g., `Cabin`), followed by using `df.dropna()` to remove rows with missing values.\n",
    "   - Before and after reports were generated to show the impact of the cleaning process, resulting in a dataset with no missing values and a reduced number of rows.\n",

    "   - I provided a Python code snippet to load the Titanic dataset from the URL using Pandas, displaying both the columns and the first five rows of the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Output**: The dataset contains 15 columns, including attributes such as `survived`, `pclass`, `sex`, `age`, `fare`, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Explanation of Observations and Variables**:\n",
    "   - **Observation**: Each row in the dataset represents a **passenger** on the Titanic, containing information such as whether they survived, their class, gender, etc.\n",
    "   - **Variable**: Each column is a **variable** (feature), such as `age`, `fare`, `survived`, etc., that describes a characteristic of the passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Generating a Brief Summary of the Data**:\n",
    "   - I showed how to use methods like `df.describe()` to generate summary statistics for numerical columns and `df['column'].value_counts()` to get the distribution of categorical data (e.g., gender, class, port of embarkation).\n",
    "   - **Summary**: \n",
    "     - `df.describe()` provides count, mean, standard deviation, etc., for numerical columns.\n",
    "     - `df.value_counts()` shows the frequency of values for categorical columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Discrepancies Between `df.shape` and `df.describe()`**:\n",
    "   - **`df.shape`** returns the total number of rows and columns (e.g., 891 rows, 15 columns).\n",
    "   - **`df.describe()`** analyzes only numerical columns by default, so the number of columns it processes is fewer than the total number in the dataset. The \"count\" in `df.describe()` reflects only non-missing values, hence it may be less than the total number of rows due to missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Difference Between Attributes and Methods**:\n",
    "   - **Attributes** (e.g., `df.shape`) are properties of an object and are accessed without parentheses. They hold information such as the dimensions of the DataFrame.\n",
    "   - **Methods** (e.g., `df.describe()`) are functions that perform an action or computation and are accessed with parentheses. Methods can accept arguments to modify their behavior.\n",

    "**4. Discussion on `df.describe()` vs. `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`:**\n",
    "- Discussed how `df.describe()` provides column-wise summary statistics, including counts of non-missing values. In contrast, `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` provides summary statistics for `col2` within each group defined by `col1`, highlighting the importance of group sizes and distribution.\n",

    "     **Solution:** Suggested verifying the file path or using a public URL for the Titanic dataset.\n",
    "   - **Issue 3: `NameError` due to missing parentheses in the `print` function.**  \n",
    "     **Solution:** Corrected the `print` statement to include parentheses for Python 3 compatibility.\n",
    "   - **Issue 4: `NameError` due to a typo in the method name (`descbrie`).**  \n",
    "     **Solution:** Corrected the typo to `describe()`.\n",
    "   - **Issue 5: Case sensitivity issue with column names (`\"type 1\"` and `\"attack\"`).**  \n",
    "     **Solution:** Corrected column names to `\"Type 1\"` and `\"Attack\"`.\n",
    "   - **Issue 6: Syntax error due to missing quotes around column names in `groupby`.**  \n",
    "     **Solution:** Added quotes around `\"Type 1\"` and `\"Attack\"`.\n",
